utho’s vps HostiNg (virtual private server HostiNg) divides a physical server into multiple vps cloud servers, each with its own dedicated resources and operatiNg system. unlike shared HostiNg, which shares resources across multiple websites, a vps server offers more control, flexibility, and power without the expense of a dedicated server. this makes utho’s High-performance vps ideal for businesses and websites that require more robust performance.
